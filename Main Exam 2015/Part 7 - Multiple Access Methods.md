# Part 7: Multiple Access Methods
#### How does TDMA work?
* Time Division Multiple Access
* A channel access method that allows several users to share the same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. The users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using it's own time slow. [Source](https://issuu.com/warse/docs/ijeter01352015)

####  How does (pure) ALOHA work?
* If the client or node has data to send, it will send it.
* If the client receives data which doesn't belong to him while he is transmitting, there has been a collision and every node that is transmitting has to try to send again later. 

#### Compare TDMA to ALOHA. What are the advantages and disadvantages?
* ANSWER

#### Under what circumstances should we prefer ALOHA over TDMA?
* ANSWER

#### Consider a broadcast channel with N nodes and a transmission rate of R bit s<sup>âˆ’1</sup>. Suppose the broadcast channel uses polling (with an additional polling node) for multiple access. Suppose the amount of time from when a node completes transmission until the subsequent node is permitted to transmit (that is, the polling delay) is d<sub>poll</sub>. Suppose that within a polling round, a given node is allowed to transmit at most Q bit. What is the maximum throughput of the broadcast channel?
