#### Suppose Host A wants to send a large file to Host B. The path from Host A to Host B has three links, of rates R<sub>1</sub> = 500 kbps, R<sub>2</sub> = 2 Mbps, R<sub>3</sub> = 1 Mbps
* i. Assuming no other traffic in the network, what is the throughput for the file transfer?
    * ANSWER
* ii. Suppose the file is 4 million bytes. Dividing the file size by the throughput, roughly how long will it take to transfer the file to Host B?
    * ANSWER
* Repeat i and ii, but now with R<sub>2</sub> reduced to 100 kbps.
    * ANSWER

#### Suppose there is a 1 Mbit/s microwave link between a geostationary satellite and its base station on Earth (distance of about 36 Mm). Every 30 seconds, the satellite takes a digital photo and sends it to the base station. Assume a propagation speed of 240 Mm/s.
* What is the propagation delay of the link?
    * ANSWER
* What is the bandwidth-delay product, R â‹… d<sub>prop</sub>?
    * ANSWER
* Let x denote the size of the photo. What is the minimum value of x for the microwave link to be continuously transmitting?
    * ANSWER
