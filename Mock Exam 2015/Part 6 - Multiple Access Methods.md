# Part 6: Multiple Access Methods
#### How does TDMA work?
* Time Division Multiple Access
* A channel access method that allows several users to share the same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. The users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using it's own time slow. [Source](https://issuu.com/warse/docs/ijeter01352015)

#### How does CSMA work?
* Carrier Sense Multiple Access (see page 531 (pdf: 558))
* A channel access method that only allows one user at a time, all transfer is deferred until the channel is detected as idle. [Source](https://issuu.com/warse/docs/ijeter01352015)

#### Compare TDMA to CSMA. What are the advantages and disadvantages?
* [Source](https://issuu.com/warse/docs/ijeter01352015)
* TDMA will utilize more bandwidth due to concurrent usage
* CSMA will scale better with larger networks
* CSMA may have long delays occur due to how access is granted
* CSMA has a high collision count due to how access is granted
