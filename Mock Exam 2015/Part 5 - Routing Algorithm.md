*  Calculate the routing table for node A using link state routing.
    * ANSWER (Expects a picture)
* Suppose, C is the gateway to a dual-homed network and does not want to forward any traffic between B and D.
    * How can C achieve this without breaking the routing algorithm?
        * ANSWER
    * Considering your solution, what route will a packet from B to D take and at what cost?
