# Part 2: HTTP
## Consider an HTTP client that wants to retrieve a Web document at a given URL. The IP address of the HTTP server is initially unknown. What transport and application-layer protocols besides HTTP are needed in this scenario?
* ANSWER

## Consider a short, 10 m link, over which a sender can transmit at a rate of 150 bit/s in both directions. Suppose that packets containing data are 100 000 bit long, and packetscontaining only control (e.g. ACK or hand-shaking) are 200 bit long. Assume that N parallel connections each get 1âˆ•N of the link bandwidth. Now consider the HTTP protocol, and suppose that each downloaded object is 100 kbit long, and that the initial downloaded object contains 10 referenced objects from the same sender.
* Would parallel downloads via parallel instances of non-persistent HTTP make sense in this case? Justify your answer.
    * ANSWER
* Now consider persistent HTTP. Do you expect significant gains over the non-persistent case? Justify and explain your answer.
