# Part 3: TCP Protocol
##  Assume we send 4000 bytes of data. Display the temporal sequence of all TCP segments send from sender to receiver. For each message, indicate the TCP flags set in the header, the sequence number and the ACK number. Assume an MTU of 1500bytes. Do not forget connection establishment and connection tear-down. Assume that there is no congestion and no packet loss. Let the receive window of the receiver be 5000 bytes large.
* ANSWER (Expects a picture)

## What is the difference between congestion control and flow control? How are both realised in TCP?
* ANSWER

## The picture in Figure 1 displays the behaviour of a TCP Reno.
